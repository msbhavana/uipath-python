# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- `pip` or `uv` package manager
- A UiPath Cloud Platform account with appropriate permissions

## Getting Started with the CLI

### Telemetry

To help us improve the developer experience, the CLI collects basic usage data about commands invocation. For more details about UiPath's privacy practices, please review the [privacy statement](https://www.uipath.com/legal/privacy-policy).

#### Disabling telemetry data

Telemetry is enabled by default, yet it is possible to opt-out by setting to `false` the `UIPATH_TELEMETRY_ENABLED` environment variable.

### Authentication

To debug your script locally and publish your project, you need to authenticate with UiPath:

uipath auth⠋ Authenticating with UiPath ...\
🔗 If a browser window did not open, please open the following URL in your browser: [LINK]\
👇 Select tenant:\
0: Tenant1\
1: Tenant2\
Select tenant number: 0\
Selected tenant: Tenant1\
✓ Authentication successful.

This command opens a new browser window for authentication. If you encounter any issues, copy the URL from the terminal and paste it into your browser. After authentication, select your tenant by entering its corresponding number in the terminal.

Upon successful authentication, your project will contain a `.env` file with your access token, UiPath URL, and other configuration details.

### Writing Your Code

Tip

This walkthrough creates a **coded function** — plain Python with typed input and output, no LLM required. For a complete reference including platform services, tracing, idempotency, and Maestro integration, see [Python Coded Functions](https://uipath.github.io/uipath-python/core/functions/index.md).

Open `main.py` in your code editor. You can start with this example code:

```
from dataclasses import dataclass


@dataclass
class EchoIn:
    message: str
    repeat: int | None = 1
    prefix: str | None = None


@dataclass
class EchoOut:
    message: str


def main(input: EchoIn) -> EchoOut:
    result = []
    for _ in range(input.repeat or 1):
        line = input.message
        if input.prefix:
            line = f"{input.prefix}: {line}"
        result.append(line)

    return EchoOut(message="\n".join(result))
```

### Initializing the UiPath Project

Before running `uipath init`, you need to create a `uipath.json` file that specifies which functions to expose. Create a `uipath.json` file in your project directory with the following content:

```
{
  "functions": {
    "main": "main.py:main"
  }
}
```

The `functions` object maps function names to their locations in the format `<file>:<function_name>`.

Now, run the initialization command:

uipath init⠋ Initializing UiPath project ...\
✓ Created 'entry-points.json' file.\
✓ Created 'bindings.json' file.

Warning

The `uipath init` command executes your `main.py` file to analyze its structure and collect information about inputs and outputs.

This command generates two files:

- `entry-points.json`: Contains the input/output schema for your functions
- `bindings.json`: Allows you to configure overridable resource bindings.

# Debug your projectuipath run main '{"message": "test"}'[2025-04-11 10:13:58,857][INFO] {'message': 'test'}

Warning

Depending on the shell you are using, it may be necessary to escape the input json:

```
uipath run main '{"message": "test"}'
```

```
uipath run main "{""message"": ""test""}"
```

```
uipath run main '{\"message\":\"test\"}'
```

### Packaging and Publishing

Before packaging your project, add your details to the `pyproject.toml` file. Add the following line below the `description` field:

```
authors = [{ name = "Your Name", email = "your.email@uipath.com" }]
```

Then, package your project:

uipath pack⠋ Packaging project ...\
Name : uipath_coded_process\
Version : 0.1.0\
Description: Add your description here\
Authors : Your Name\
✓ Project successfully packaged.

Finally, publish your package:

uipath publish⠋ Fetching available package feeds...\
👇 Select package feed:\
0: Orchestrator Tenant Processes Feed\
1: Orchestrator Personal Workspace Feed\
Select feed number: 0\
Selected feed: Orchestrator Tenant Processes Feed\
⠸ Publishing most recent package: uipath_coded_process.0.1.0.nupkg ...\
✓ Package published successfully!

After selecting your publishing destination (tenant or personal workspace), you'll see details about your package and a confirmation message.

## Integrating with the UiPath Platform

Create a **new project** (separate from the one you just packaged and published) following the same steps as above. This new project will invoke your previous process using the UiPath SDK.

Open `main.py` in your code editor and add the following code:

```
from uipath.platform import UiPath


def main():
    sdk = UiPath()
    sdk.processes.invoke(
        "uipath_coded_process",
        input_arguments={
            "message": "Hello, World!",
            "repeat": 3,
            "prefix": "[Echo]"
        },
        folder_path="PROCESS_FOLDER_PATH_HERE"
    )
```

Warning

An agent can invoke itself if needed, but this must be done with caution. Be mindful that using the same name for invocation may lead to unintentional loops. To prevent recursion issues, implement safeguards like exit conditions.

### Verifying the Execution

uipath run main.py

Open your browser and navigate to UiPath. Go to the specified folder, where you'll see a new job for `uipath_coded_process` has been executed. The output will be:

```
[Echo]: Hello, World! Echo: Hello, World! Echo: Hello, World!
```
