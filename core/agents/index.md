# Python Coded Agents

A coded agent is Python code that uses an LLM reasoning loop to make decisions, call tools, and produce a result. You write the agent logic using a framework of your choice — the `uipath` SDK provides the platform layer: authentication, assets, buckets, connections, tracing, and human-in-the-loop. Package it with the CLI and deploy it as an Orchestrator job.

Use a coded agent when your automation needs multi-step reasoning, dynamic tool selection, or LLM-driven decisions. Use a [coded function](https://uipath.github.io/uipath-python/core/functions/index.md) when your logic is deterministic and no LLM is required.

______________________________________________________________________

## Architecture

Every coded agent is built from two layers:

| Layer         | Package                   | Responsibility                                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Platform**  | `uipath`                  | Auth, assets, buckets, connections, tracing, human-in-the-loop, CLI, packaging |
| **Framework** | one extension (see below) | LLM calls, tool routing, agent loop, memory                                    |

The `uipath` package is always required. Add one framework extension on top:

| Framework              | Package                  | Best for                                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| LangChain / LangGraph  | `uipath-langchain`       | Graph-based agents, complex multi-step flows |
| LlamaIndex             | `uipath-llamaindex`      | RAG-heavy agents, document reasoning         |
| OpenAI Agents SDK      | `uipath-openai-agents`   | OpenAI-native tool use, handoffs             |
| PydanticAI             | `uipath-pydantic-ai`     | Type-safe agents with Pydantic models        |
| Google ADK             | `uipath-google-adk`      | Gemini models, Google ecosystem              |
| UiPath Agent Framework | `uipath-agent-framework` | UiPath-native agent primitives               |

______________________________________________________________________

## Quickstart

The example below uses LangChain. Swap `uipath-langchain` for the framework of your choice.

mkdir my-agent && cd my-agentuv init . --python 3.11uv add uipath uipath-langchainuipath auth⠋ Authenticating with UiPath ...\
✓ Authentication successful.\
uipath new agent✓ Created new agent project.\
uipath init⠋ Initializing UiPath project ...\
✓ Created 'entry-points.json' file.\
✓ Created 'bindings.json' file.\
uipath run agent '{"message": "hello"}'

mkdir my-agent && cd my-agentpython -m venv .venvsource .venv/bin/activatepip install uipath uipath-langchainuipath auth⠋ Authenticating with UiPath ...\
✓ Authentication successful.\
uipath new agent✓ Created new agent project.\
uipath init⠋ Initializing UiPath project ...\
✓ Created 'entry-points.json' file.\
✓ Created 'bindings.json' file.\
uipath run agent '{"message": "hello"}'

______________________________________________________________________

## Project Structure

```
my-agent/
├── main.py            # agent logic
├── pyproject.toml     # project metadata and dependencies
├── uipath.json        # entry point declarations
├── entry-points.json  # generated — I/O JSON Schema
└── bindings.json      # generated — resource binding overrides
```

### `uipath.json`

```
{
  "agents": {
    "agent": "main.py:agent"
  }
}
```

### `pyproject.toml`

```
[project]
name = "my-agent"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "..."
authors = [{ name = "Your Name", email = "you@example.com" }]
requires-python = ">=3.11"
dependencies = ["uipath>=2.0", "uipath-langchain>=2.0"]

[tool.uipath]
type = "agent"
```

`[tool.uipath] type = "agent"` is required — it identifies the project as an agent to the runtime and packaging tools.

______________________________________________________________________

## Input & Output

Define `Input` and `Output` as Python dataclasses, the same way as [coded functions](https://uipath.github.io/uipath-python/core/functions/#input--output):

```
from dataclasses import dataclass


@dataclass
class Input:
    message: str


@dataclass
class Output:
    response: str


def agent(input: Input) -> Output:
    ...
```

______________________________________________________________________

## Platform Services

The `uipath` SDK gives your agent access to Orchestrator resources at runtime — credentials are injected automatically when running as a job.

```
from uipath.platform import UiPath

sdk = UiPath()
```

The full set of Orchestrator services is available to agents:

- **Assets** — read credentials and configuration: [Assets reference](https://uipath.github.io/uipath-python/core/assets/index.md)
- **Buckets** — download and upload files: [Buckets reference](https://uipath.github.io/uipath-python/core/buckets/index.md)
- **Connections** — Integration Service connections for ERP and SaaS: [Connections reference](https://uipath.github.io/uipath-python/core/connections/index.md)
- **Context Grounding** — semantic search over enterprise data: [Context Grounding reference](https://uipath.github.io/uipath-python/core/context_grounding/index.md)

______________________________________________________________________

## Tracing

Apply `@traced` to custom steps inside your agent to make them visible in the Orchestrator job trace view and Maestro dashboards. Do **not** trace the entry point — the runtime wraps it automatically.

```
from uipath.tracing import traced


@traced(name="lookup_vendor", run_type="uipath")
def lookup_vendor(vendor_id: str) -> dict:
    ...
```

See [Tracing](https://uipath.github.io/uipath-python/core/traced/index.md) for the full decorator reference.

## Framework Guides

Each framework extension has its own getting started guide and sample agents:

| Framework              | Guide                                                                                                              | Samples                                                                                                           |

## Pack & Publish

The same CLI workflow applies as for coded functions:

uipath pack⠋ Packaging project ...\
Name : my-agent\
Version : 0.1.0\
Description: Add your description here\
Authors : Your Name\
✓ Project successfully packaged.\
uipath publish⠋ Fetching available package feeds...\
Select feed number: 0\
✓ Package published successfully!

After publishing, the agent registers as an Orchestrator Process and can be invoked from Maestro, the Orchestrator API, or the CLI.

See [CLI Reference](https://uipath.github.io/uipath-python/cli/index.md) for full `pack`, `publish`, and `invoke` options.

______________________________________________________________________

## Studio Web Integration

Connect your agent to a Studio Web solution for cloud debugging, evaluation, and solution packaging.

See [Studio Web Integration](https://uipath.github.io/uipath-python/core/studio_web/index.md) for setup and sync details.

______________________________________________________________________

## Evaluations

Coded agents support evaluations in Studio Web and locally via `uipath eval`. Evaluators cover LLM output quality, tool call correctness, and trajectory analysis.

See the [Evaluations documentation](https://uipath.github.io/uipath-python/eval/index.md) for available evaluators and how to define evaluation sets.
