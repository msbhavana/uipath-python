# Quickstart Guide: UiPath LangChain Agents

## Introduction

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up, creating, publishing, and running your first UiPath-LangChain Agent.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.11 or higher
- `pip` or `uv` package manager
- A UiPath Automation Cloud account with appropriate permissions

By default, the quickstart agent uses UiPath LLM Gateway, which provides access to any LLM provider without requiring API keys. Alternatively, you can configure your agent to connect directly to the LLM provider of your choice (such as Anthropic or OpenAI) by providing the appropriate API key as an environment variable.

For more details, see the [Chat Models documentation](https://uipath.github.io/uipath-python/langchain/chat_models/#chat-models).

Optional: Using alternative LLM providers

1. **Anthropic** - Generate an Anthropic API key [here](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys).
1. **OpenAI** - Generate an OpenAI API key [here](https://platform.openai.com).

## Creating a New Project

We recommend using `uv` for package management. To create a new project:

mkdir examplecd example

New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path exampleSet-Location example

# Initialize a new uv project in the current directoryuv init . --python 3.11# Create a new virtual environment# By default, uv creates a virtual environment in a directory called .venvuv venvUsing CPython 3.11.16 interpreter at: [PATH]

Creating virtual environment at: .venv\
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate

# Activate the virtual environment# For Windows PowerShell/ Windows CMD: .venv\\Scripts\\activate# For Windows Bash: source .venv/Scripts/activatesource .venv/bin/activate# Install the uipath packageuv add uipath-langchain# Verify the uipath installationuipath -lvuipath-langchain version 0.1.0

## Create Your First UiPath Agent

Generate your first UiPath LangChain agent:

uipath new my-agent⠋ Creating new agent my-agent in current directory ...\
✓ Created 'main.py' file.\
✓ Created 'langgraph.json' file.\
✓ Created 'pyproject.toml' file.\
💡 Initialize project: uipath init\
💡 Run agent: uipath run agent '{"topic": "UiPath"}'

This command creates the following files:

| File Name        | Description                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `main.py`        | LangGraph agent code.                                                                                                             |
| `langgraph.json` | [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/application_structure/#file-structure) specific configuration file. |
| `pyproject.toml` | Project metadata and dependencies as per [PEP 518](https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/).                                            |

## Authenticate With UiPath

uipath auth⠋ Authenticating with UiPath ...\
🔗 If a browser window did not open, please open the following URL in your browser: [LINK]\
👇 Select tenant:\

1: Tenant2\
Select tenant number: 0\
Selected tenant: Tenant1\
✓ Authentication successful.

## Initialize Project

uipath init⠋ Initializing UiPath project ...\
✓ Created '.env' file.\
✓ Created 'agent.mermaid' file.\
✓ Created 'entry-points.json' file.\
✓ Created 'bindings.json' file.

This command creates the following files:

| File Name           | Description                                                                  |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.env`              | Environment variables and secrets (this file will not be packed & published) |
| `entry-points.json` | Contains the input/output and graph schemas of your graphs                   |
| `bindings.json`     | Allows you to configure overridable resource bindings                        |
| `agent.mermaid`     | Graph visual representation                                                  |

## Run The Agent Locally

Execute the agent with a sample input:

uipath run agent '{"topic": "UiPath"}'[2025-04-29 12:31:57,756][INFO] ((), {'topic': 'UiPath'})\
[2025-04-29 12:32:07,689][INFO] ((), {'topic': 'UiPath', 'report': "..."})

This command runs your agent locally and displays the report in the standard output.

Warning

Depending on the shell you are using, it may be necessary to escape the input json:

```
uipath run agent '{"topic": "UiPath"}'
```

```
uipath run agent "{""topic"": ""UiPath""}"
```

```
uipath run agent '{\"topic\":\"uipath\"}'
```

Attention

For a shell agnostic option, please refer to the next section.

### (Optional) Run The Agent with a json File as Input

The `run` command can also take a .json file as an input. You can create a file named `input.json` having the following content:

```
{
  "topic": "UiPath"
}
```

Use this file as agent input:

```
> uipath run agent --file input.json
```

## Deploy the Agent to UiPath Automation Cloud

Follow these steps to publish and run your agent to UiPath Automation Cloud:

### (Optional) Customize the Package

Update author details in `pyproject.toml`:

```
authors = [{ name = "Your Name", email = "your.name@example.com" }]
```

### Package Your Project

uipath pack⠋ Packaging project ...\
Name : test\
Version : 0.1.0\
Description: Add your description here\
Authors : Your Name\
✓ Project successfully packaged.

### Publish To My Workspace

uipath publish --my-workspace⠙ Publishing most recent package: my-agent.0.0.1.nupkg ...\
✓ Package published successfully!\
⠦ Getting process information ...\
🔗 Process configuration link: [LINK]\
💡 Use the link above to configure any environment variables

Info

Please note that a process will be auto-created only upon publishing to **my-workspace** package feed.

Set the environment variables using the provided link:

## Invoke the Agent on UiPath Automation Cloud

uipath invoke agent '{"topic": "UiPath"}'⠴ Loading configuration ...\
⠴ Starting job ...\
✨ Job started successfully!\
🔗 Monitor your job here: [LINK]

Use the provided link to monitor your job and view detailed traces.

### (Optional) Invoke The Agent with a json File as Input

The `invoke` command operates similarly to the `run` command, allowing you to use the same .json file defined in the [(Optional) Run the agent with a .json file as input](#optional-run-the-agent-with-a-json-file-as-input) section, as agent input:

```
> uipath invoke agent --file input.json
```

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You have successfully set up, created, published, and run a UiPath LangChain Agent. 🚀
